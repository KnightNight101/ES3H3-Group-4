# ES3H3-Group-4

## Brief

The goal of the assignment is to build a system that recognizes hand gestures using a webcam. 
You should select your own set of hand gestures that should be recognized – you have full control over the number and type of gestures to be recognized.
    • You will be allocated into a team of 5-6 students for this project.
    • Your team must collect their own training and test data.
    • You may use transfer learning for this project, but do not use an existing pre-trained model for hand/gesture recognition.
    • Each team shall present for 10mins and have 5mins to answer questions and show the working system.
    • The presentation should include:
        o Explanation of your method – describe is the approach you used and why you choose it.
        o The testing of your system (what are the limitations of your system?)
        o Live demo of your system (have a recorded demo of your system as a backup in case there are problems)
## Meetings + Notes
### 24/01/24

 - [For 31/01/24]Everyone try and develop the neural network so that we can build off of the most advanced / stable version
 - [For 25/01/24]Submit video of all gestures (see above for formats and gestures)

## Data Collection

### Video Format

1080p 30fps mp4
30fps
mp4
Non-Inverted
    This means that if you film a video it looks like a mirror and doesn't flip it

Please also add videos of the gestures wherever possible to the "Videos to cut" folder and [send me a message](https://wa.me/447713046132) and I'll cut it and put it in the "Training Data" folder

### Gestures
 
 - Wave
 - Thank you
 - Rock
 - Paper
 - Scissors
 - 1
 - 2
 - 3
 - 4
 - 5 

### Scenarios
 - Hand colour
 - Gloves
 - Angles

### Backgrounds (variation in colours, noise, distance from camera)
 - Close to camera
 - Far from camera
 - Outdoors greenery
 - Indoors lots of objects
 - Low light
 - Bright light
