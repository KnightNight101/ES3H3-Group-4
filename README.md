#### Wave
#### Thank you
#### Rock
#### Paper
#### Scissors
#### 1
#### 2
#### 3
#### 4
#### 5 

### Scenarios
#### Hand colour
#### Gloves
#### Angles

### Backgrounds (variation in colours, noise, distance from camera)
#### Close to camera
#### Far from camera
#### Outdoors greenery
#### Indoors lots of objects
#### Low light

#### Description of dataset(s) used
#### Details of training process (if applicable)
### Performance of developed system (40%):
#### Number of gestures recognized
#### Reliability/robustness of system
#### Can the system be demonstrated live?
### Testing of developed system (30%):

## 24/01/24

 - [For 31/01/24]Everyone try and develop the neural network so that we can build off of the most advanced / stable version
 - [For 25/01/24]Submit video of all gestures (see above for formats and gestures)
